They:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>broker prices, contracts, and logistics,</li>\n  <li>gate access to subsidies, credit, and services,</li>\n  <li>translate, summarize, and narrate the world on behalf of institutions and platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If Andean and other Indigenous communities do not exist inside this new “intelligence layer” in their own languages, with their own institutions and boundaries encoded, they risk interface poverty:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>treated as illegible: no data, no standard fields, no recognized authority,</li>\n  <li>mispriced: buyers’ agents see “risk” without context or ignore communal protections,</li>\n  <li>extracted from: cultural and ecological knowledge scraped into models with no consent or reciprocity,</li>\n  <li>governed from elsewhere: optimization routines overwrite communal calendars, water rules, and sacred limits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This trajectory is not inevitable and not merely technical. It is a political design choice about:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>whose values become defaults,</li>\n  <li>whose governance has binding force,</li>\n  <li>who has the recognized right to say “no”, “not like this”, or “stop”.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reciprocal Intelligence is a proposal to make a different choice.</p>",

  "ri_part1_section3_title": "3. Definition: what Reciprocal Intelligence is",
  "ri_part1_section3_body": "<p>Reciprocal Intelligence (RI) is a design and governance standard for AI and agent systems in Indigenous and rural territories. A system aligned with RI must satisfy three core properties:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Reciprocity as obligation:</strong> every interaction involving community data, knowledge, infrastructure, or risk carries enforceable reciprocity duties defined locally (Ayni).</li>\n  <li><strong>Community authority as law:</strong> legitimate institutions hold binding power to grant or withhold consent, set boundaries, audit behavior, and pause or terminate systems.</li>\n  <li><strong>Community infrastructure as substrate:</strong> critical functions—policy enforcement, logs, kill switch, key services—run on community-controlled, offline-capable infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>RI stands against one-way extraction, shallow “inclusion” narratives, and infrastructures that render communities legible only as markets or datasets.</p>",

  "ri_part1_section5_body": "<p>The <em>Consejo de IA Comunitaria</em> (Community AI Council) is the primary local authority for AI and agents under RI. It is not an external ethics committee; it evolves from assemblies, sectoral committees, cooperatives, spiritual authorities, and existing Indigenous protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-negotiable mandates:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Exercise FPIC vivo—approve, reject, or revoke projects as consent conditions change.</li>\n  <li>Lead creation of Cultural Boundary Cards defining sacred, communal, shared, and public knowledge.</li>\n  <li>Audit systems for cultural distortion, bias, disrespect, and harm.</li>\n  <li>Control hardware and software kill switches to pause or exit deployments.</li>\n  <li>Oversee Value Return Agreements and the Reciprocity Ledger.</li>\n  <li>Report transparently to the asamblea and remain recallable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Composition principles include representation (women, youth, language keepers, spiritual stewards), term limits, and clear decision rules.</p>",
