  "whitepaper_exec_title": "Executive Summary",
  "whitepaper_exec_body": "<p>By 2030, artificial intelligence will organize much of public and economic life—from decisions about identity and access to justice, health, culture, and livelihoods. Without intentional design, this AI-first world will not replace marginalized communities; it will bypass them. For local Andean communities in Cusco, exclusion is not only technological—it is historical and ongoing. The key risk ahead is not mass unemployment; it is being designed out of AI’s imagination.</p><p>This white paper proposes a different path: reciprocal intelligence. We situate AI within Andean cosmology—not as metaphor, but as the governing epistemology. Ayni (reciprocity), Minka (collective work), and Yachay–Llankay–Munay (wisdom–work–heart) become requirements, not slogans. We align these with the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI (2021), the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance, and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).</p><p>We introduce two proposed tools:</p><ul><li><strong>The Higher Self Protocol:</strong> a governance model that translates Andean and human-rights principles into concrete technical and procedural requirements. It defines consent as explicit, revocable, and purposeful; classifies knowledge to protect the sacred; establishes a ledger for benefit return; and centers community authority without presuming it.</li><li><strong>An open-source, offline-first AI agent:</strong> designed to run without internet connectivity using Bluetooth or SMS mesh, with a consent engine and a proposed instantiation tailored to local community archives, language, and craft contexts.</li></ul><p>Our recommendations are practical: fund community-governed AI labs in rural Andean regions; operationalize Law 29735 on Indigenous languages within AI services; mandate community benefit agreements for any AI trained on marginalized knowledge; and invest in offline-first infrastructure stewarded by local communities. Researchers should shift from “for” to “by and with,” publishing only with consent, co-authorship, and open licensing that respects data sovereignty.</p><p>AI will not replace these communities—it will bypass them unless we design differently. This paper proposes a path where AI practices Ayni: every interaction returns value, consent, and agency to those most at risk of being left behind.</p>",
  "whitepaper_trends_title": "The AI-First World: Trends and Exclusions (2025–2030)",
  "whitepaper_trends_body": "<h3>Global adoption patterns</h3><ul><li><strong>Justice and security:</strong> Risk assessment tools, biometric identity systems, and predictive analytics are expanding in policing, courts, and border control. Even when promoted as neutral, these systems encode historical bias and amplify surveillance.</li><li><strong>Cultural production:</strong> Generative models produce images, music, and textiles trained on global cultural corpora, often without consent or benefit-sharing. Heritage is scraped as data.</li><li><strong>Labor and livelihoods:</strong> Automation and augmentation shift work conditions across agriculture, craft economies, logistics, education, and care. “Efficiency” metrics reorganize value chains, often squeezing those with the least bargaining power.</li><li><strong>Identity, access, and welfare:</strong> AI undergirds digital identity systems, eligibility decisions, and public services. When signals of identity or eligibility are missing or misaligned with local realities, entire populations are excluded.</li></ul><h3>The myth of “AI for all” versus digital redlining</h3><p>In practice, access to AI is segmented by infrastructure, language, and legal status. Digital redlining—where whole regions and communities are omitted from high-quality digital services—reproduces older geographies of neglect. Systems that translate between dominant languages and legal codes thrive; those that speak Indigenous languages and honor communal law are scarcely designed. Communities without protected digital rights are often removed from digital life altogether.</p><h3>Peru’s context</h3><ul><li><strong>Policy landscape:</strong> Peru has pursued digital transformation policies and is engaging on AI strategy components. Implementation across geographies remains uneven. Coordination between ministries, Indigenous authorities, and the justice sector is in progress but faces capacity and resource constraints.</li><li><strong>Connectivity gaps:</strong> Rural Andean and Amazonian regions experience lower household internet access and inconsistent mobile coverage. Infrastructure fragility (power, backhaul) undermines continuous connectivity.</li><li><strong>Language rights:</strong> Law 29735 recognizes Indigenous languages and mandates their use in public services. Most AI interfaces, datasets, and public digital services do not yet consistently operationalize Quechua or Aymara at parity.</li></ul>",

Indigenous Andean communities</h3><h4>Current realities</h4><ul><li><strong>Livelihoods and markets:</strong> Many weavers participate in an informal economy facing price volatility and middleman capture. Authenticity and provenance are difficult to signal in global markets without risking exposure of sacred knowledge.</li><li><strong>Cultural appropriation:</strong> Andean patterns, stories, and dyes are routinely reproduced without consent or attribution, including by generative AI models trained on scraped images.</li><li><strong>Language erosion:</strong> Despite legal recognition, Quechua and Aymara remain underrepresented in digital systems, contributing to intergenerational loss of language use and prestige.</li></ul><h4>AI risks</h4><ul><li><strong>Unconsented training:</strong> Generative models learn from sacred motifs and communal narratives without permission, stripping context and redistributing value far from origin communities.</li><li><strong>Extraction of tacit knowledge:</strong> “Documentation” projects can fix living knowledge into datasets, freezing and exposing it to misuse.</li><li><strong>Identity harms:</strong> Mislabeling, caricature, or commercial dilution erodes cultural dignity and creates confusion about what is sacred, communal, or public.</li></ul><h4>Opportunity: AI as cultural steward—offline, consent-based, community-governed</h4><ul><li>Local, offline agents that operate in Quechua and Spanish can help manage archives, guide apprenticeships, and record oral histories under community-controlled governance.</li><li>Consent engines can allow weavers to tag designs as sacred (not for reproduction), communal with conditions, or public, and to specify what returns of value are appropriate.</li><li>Community dashboards can track how local knowledge is used, by whom, and for what, establishing reciprocal flows of benefit.</li></ul><h3>B. Incarcerated populations</h3><h4>Current realities</h4><ul><li><strong>Carceral infrastructure:</strong> Facilities are surveillance-heavy but education- and health-light. Access to mental health services, legal awareness, and digital literacy is limited.</li><li><strong>Stigma and reintegration:</strong> Stigma restricts pathways to dignified work and social reentry.</li></ul><h4>AI risks</h4><ul><li><strong>Predictive policing and behavioral monitoring:</strong> Algorithmic tools that claim to predict risk can harden bias, punish poverty, and legitimize intrusive monitoring with thin evidence.</li><li><strong>Digital exclusion by design:</strong> Prohibitions on technology often sever people from the digital skills needed to reenter society, compounding marginalization.</li></ul><h4>Opportunity: AI as a dignity tool—zero external data transfer</h4><ul><li>Offline kiosks and devices can provide mental health self-support, legal information access, and reintegration planning without any external connectivity.</li><li>Local agents can help individuals understand rights under the Mandela Rules, prepare for hearings, and develop education/work plans that translate into opportunities post-release.</li></ul><p class=\"key-insight\"><strong>Key insight:</strong> These groups will not be “unemployed by AI”—they will be designed out of its imagination unless we change how AI is conceived, built, and governed.</p>",

Every use defines what, why, who, and for how long.</li><li><strong>Multi-layered roles:</strong> Individual, family, guild/ayllu, and community council consent where appropriate to the knowledge domain.</li><li><strong>Revocation that works offline:</strong> Consent records stored locally; revocations propagate via Bluetooth/SMS “gossip” sync, so withdrawal does not depend on internet access.</li></ul><h4>Knowledge classification and sanctuaries</h4><ul><li><strong>Sacred:</strong> Not to be digitized or reproduced. Metadata tags enforce “no-train, no-generate, no-share” policies at the model layer. Requests attempting to access sacred tagged content produce refusal or redirection.</li><li><strong>Communal with conditions:</strong> Portions of knowledge that can be recorded or shared under community-defined terms (e.g., attribution, non-commercial use, ritual context).</li><li><strong>Public:</strong> Content freely shareable under licenses chosen by the community.</li></ul><h4>Ayni ledger (benefit return)</h4><ul><li>Every authorized use triggers a benefit entry: funds, capacity-building hours, language content creation, or infrastructure contributions.</li><li>Ledger is community-readable offline and verifiable with simple audits. Aggregated insights guide collective decision-making.</li></ul><h4>Accountability and redress</h4><ul><li>Community oversight group (defined locally) can audit logs, pause systems, and mandate remediation.</li><li>Redress pathways: Individuals can contest use, request deletion, or seek compensation, with escalation routes beyond the project team if needed.</li></ul><h4>Data minimization and locality</h4><ul><li>“No more than needed” is default. Sensitive data never leaves community control or prison premises.</li><li>Data stores are encrypted, access-scoped, and mirrored on community-managed hardware with key custody held locally.</li></ul><h4>Transparent operations</h4><ul><li>“Explain my answer” function reveals, in plain language, the sources and steps the agent used for a reply.</li><li>System cards document model versions, training sources, known limits, and safety constraints.</li></ul><h4>Environmental care</h4><ul><li>Energy budgets and e-waste plans are part of deployment. Preference for low-power hardware and repairable devices.</li></ul><h3>Technical expression</h3><ul><li>Consent and knowledge tags are enforced at three layers: interface (what can be asked), policy engine (what can be processed), model runtime (what can be generated). Cross-layer enforcement reduces leakage.</li><li>Revocation indexes and audit logs use append-only local stores with cryptographic checks, syncing peer-to-peer when possible.</li></ul>",

Clear disclaimers that it is not a clinician.</li><li><strong>Legal rights library:</strong> Plain-language summaries of Peruvian legal processes, Mandela Rules, and facility policies; form-filling assistance that produces printouts for review by appointed legal aid.</li><li><strong>Reintegration planning:</strong> Skills inventory, education modules, and a personal plan builder that translates to concrete steps for reentry support services.</li><li><strong>Literacy and numeracy:</strong> Short, offline modules with culturally relevant examples; tracking is stored locally and accessible to the individual.</li></ul><h4>Hardware and placement</h4><ul><li>Locked-down, tamper-evident kiosks with e-ink or durable screens in supervised but private spaces; dedicated devices for counselor offices.</li><li>No network cards enabled; only wired power. Data export possible only via staff-certified print or read-outs to the individual.</li></ul><h4>Safeguards</h4><ul><li><strong>Zero external data transfer:</strong> No internet, no USB mass storage, no wireless. Logs are individual-accessible; administrators have access only to system health—not to private content—unless the person opts in.</li><li><strong>Safety escalation:</strong> Language model detects crisis language and provides grounding exercises, then prompts the user to request human support; no punitive flags.</li><li><strong>Bias minimization:</strong> The agent refuses to label risk or forecast behavior.

  "whitepaper_conclusion_body": "<p>The AI-first world is not inevitable; it is designed. We are in conversation with those who have long practiced reciprocal wisdom. From them, we learn: technology must serve life, not extraction. If AI is to have a place in the Andes and behind prison walls, it must practice Ayni—returning value for every touch; it must move with Minka—built in collective work; and it must be measured in Yachay, Llankay, and Munay—wisdom, work, and heart held together.</p><p>This is the path Qori Labs is exploring. We will not claim to lead; we seek to earn the right to co-create, by consent, at the pace of trust, and with clear lines between research and commerce. The work ahead is technical, legal, and cultural. Above all, it is ethical. Join us in making an AI world that does not bypass those at the margins, but learns—humbly—to stand with them.</p>",
