  "whitepaper_disclaimer_body": "<p>Qori Labs is a non-commercial initiative.</p>\n<p>This document presents Reciprocal Intelligence, a community-based, offline SMS service for local alerts.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical status:</strong> Technically validated through unit, integration, and SMS simulation tests in a controlled environment.</p>\n<p>No community deployment or real GSM network testing yet. Any field validation will only occur after appropriate ethical approvals, collective consent (FPIC), and required permits.</p>\n<p><strong>Focus:</strong> This is a refined result of a prior exploratory phase that evaluated different transport methods and consent architectures.</p>\n<p>Reciprocal Intelligence archives all non-SMS components and focuses on immediate usefulness, FPIC compliance, and local steward operation.</p>",
  "whitepaper_exec_title": "Executive Summary",
  "whitepaper_exec_body": "<p>In many rural Andean communities, frequent challenges are reported:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Long trips to health posts that turn out to be closed.</li>\n  <li>Below-market prices due to information asymmetries.</li>\n  <li>Difficulty participating in community decisions due to care responsibilities or distance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reciprocal Intelligence addresses these issues through simple, free SMS alerts:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>HEALTH:</strong> Notices about services and availability of health posts.</li>\n  <li><strong>PRICE:</strong> Fair price references before going to the market or buyer.</li>\n  <li><strong>COMMUNITY:</strong> Reminders for meetings and local announcements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is not \"AI\" &mdash; it is about who controls information.</p>\n<p>Reciprocal Intelligence returns that control to the community: local stewards send alerts with prior collective consent and built-in privacy.</p>",

  "whitepaper_conclusion_body": "<p>The AI-first world is not inevitable; it is designed. We are in conversation with those who have long practiced reciprocal wisdom. From them, we learn: technology must serve life, not extraction. If AI is to have a place in the Andes, it must practice Ayni—returning value for every touch; it must move with Minka—built in collective work; and it must be measured in Yachay, Llankay, and Munay—wisdom, work, and heart held together.</p><p>This is the path Qori Labs is exploring. We will not claim to lead; we seek to earn the right to co-create, by consent, at the pace of trust, and with clear lines between research and commerce. The work ahead is technical, legal, and cultural. Above all, it is ethical. Join us in making an AI world that does not bypass those at the margins, but learns—humbly—to stand with them.</p>",
